## Topic Chosen
- Canvas in Web Development

## Example Referenced
- Based on the example provided by [W3Schools - Canvas Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_examples.asp).

## Changes Made
- The original example demonstrated basic shape drawing on a canvas.
- Modified it to dynamically draw different shapes at the click location instead of a fixed position.
- Implemented shape cycling logic, where each click triggers a new shape.
- Added backend communication, where the application fetches a number from the backend, increments it, and determines which shape to draw.
- Implemented text drawing
- Added a canvas reset after 20 clicks.

## Description of the Program
- This web application allows users to click on a canvas to place various shapes at the click location.
- Each click pastes a new shape or text of a different color based on a number stored and incremented in the backend.
- After 20 clicks, the canvas resets automatically.
